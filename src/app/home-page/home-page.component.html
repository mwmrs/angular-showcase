  <h3>The model: Conference Management System</h3>
  <p>This showcase implements a simple Conference Management System to demonstrate various Angular features and best practices. The system includes the following main entities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conference (main entity)</li>
    <li>Venue (1:1 relation with Conference)</li>
    <li>Session (1:n relation with Conference)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This model allows us to demonstrate form groups, form arrays, and various form controls while keeping the structure relatively simple.</p>
